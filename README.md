This project focuses on analysing video game sales data on Tableau through data visualizations to gain insights into the industry. Video games have become an integral part of the entertainment industry since the 1980s, and their commercial importance has been increasing, driven by emerging markets and mobile games. The dataset used for this analysis contains records from 1989 to 2016 and includes information such as the name of the video game, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, sales data from different regions, critic and user scores, developer, and rating.

The analysis involves various visualizations to explore different aspects of the dataset. Key findings include:

1.	Action and Sports genres are the most popular among video games.
2.	Electronic Arts is the publisher with the highest number of games released.
3.	The number of video games being released has shown a gradual increase, with a preference for Action and Sports genres.
